# Pandas-code-challenge
# Phase 1 Code Challenge
This code challenge is designed to test your understanding of the Phase 1 material. It covers:

- Pandas
- Data Visualization
- Exploring Statistical Data
- Python Data Structures

*Read the instructions carefully.* Your code will need to meet detailed specifications to pass automated tests.

## Code Tests

We have provided some code tests for you to run to check that your work meets the item specifications. 
Passing these tests does not necessarily mean that you have gotten the item correct - there are additional hidden tests. However, if any of the tests do not pass, this tells you that your code is incorrect and needs changes to meet the specification. 
To determine what the issue is, read the comments in the code test cells, the error message you receive, and the item instructions.
